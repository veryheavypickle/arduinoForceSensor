# Arduino Force Sensor

This arduino code is used in combination with a [p5.js page](https://github.com/veryheavypickle/p5jsArduinoForceGUI) that displays the pressure applied to the sensor.

This is also used in another project with an arduino to [control addressible LEDs](https://github.com/veryheavypickle/ArduinoLEDs)
